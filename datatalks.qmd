I co-founded **Datatalks Consulting** at UCLA in 2024 and currently serve as the President. I have always championed the idea of giving back to the community, aiming to use data skills to create meaningful impact and improve society.

Since our founding, we have collaborated with **8 non-profit organizations** across Southern California, supporting causes including animal welfare, LGBTQ+ rights, conservation corps, and more.
